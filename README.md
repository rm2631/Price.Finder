git clone https://github.com/rm2631/Price.Finder.git
cd Price.Finder
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

**Launch the web interface:**
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

Your browser will automatically open to the MTG Deal Finder interface. Simply paste your card list and click "Search for Cards"!

## üíª Usage

### Web UI (Recommended)

The easiest way to use MTG Deal Finder is through the web interface:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

This will open a browser window where you can:
- Paste your card list directly (no file needed)
- Configure all search options through an intuitive interface
- View results in an interactive table
- Download results as Excel directly in your browser

All CLI options are available in the UI with helpful tooltips explaining each option.

### Command-Line Usage

Create a text file with one card per line (e.g., `cards.txt`):
```
Lightning Bolt
Sol Ring
Counterspell (7ED)
Brainstorm x4
```

Run the tool:
```bash
python -m mtg_deal_finder cards.txt --out results.xlsx
```

### Command-Line Options

```bash
python -m mtg_deal_finder <input_file> [options]

Options:
  --out, -o FILE          Output Excel file path (default: results.xlsx)
  --store STORES          Comma-separated list of stores to search (e.g., facetoface,topdeckhero,topdeckboucherville,topdeckjoliette,mtgjeuxjubes)
  --strategy, -s STRATEGY Selection strategy for choosing best card (default: cheapest)
  --min-quality, -q QUAL  Minimum card quality/condition to consider (e.g., nm, lp, mp)
  --topdeck-discount      Apply TopDeck's 20% checkout discount to prices (applies to TopDeckHero, TopDeckBoucherville, TopDeckJoliette, and MTGJeuxJubes)
  --no-cache              Disable caching of search results
  --debug                 Enable debug logging
```

### Minimum Quality Filter

You can filter results to only show cards that meet a minimum quality requirement:

```bash
# Only show Near Mint or better cards
python -m mtg_deal_finder cards.txt --min-quality nm

# Only show Lightly Played or better cards
python -m mtg_deal_finder cards.txt --min-quality lp
```

**Quality levels** (from best to worst):
- **mint** or **m**: Mint condition
- **nm**: Near Mint
- **lp**: Lightly Played
- **mp**: Moderately Played
- **played** or **pl**: Played
- **hp**: Heavily Played
- **damaged** or **dmg**: Damaged

When you specify a minimum quality, only cards at that quality level or better will be considered. For example, `--min-quality lp` will show Near Mint and Lightly Played cards, but filter out Moderately Played, Played, Heavily Played, and Damaged cards.

### Selection Strategies

The tool supports multiple strategies for selecting the best card offer:

- **cheapest** (default): Selects the lowest price regardless of condition or foil status
- **cheapest-nonfoil**: Selects the cheapest non-foil version
- **cheapest-foil**: Selects the cheapest foil version
- **foil-first-cheapest**: Prefers foil cards - selects the cheapest foil if available, otherwise falls back to the cheapest non-foil
- **best-condition**: Selects the cheapest Near Mint condition card
- **blingiest**: Selects the most expensive foil card (for "bling" factor)

All strategies respect the minimum quality filter if specified.

Example using a strategy:
```bash
python -m mtg_deal_finder cards.txt --strategy best-condition --out nm_results.xlsx
```

Example combining strategy with minimum quality:
```bash
# Get the cheapest non-foil card, but only LP or better
python -m mtg_deal_finder cards.txt --strategy cheapest-nonfoil --min-quality lp
```

### TopDeck Discount

TopDeck stores (TopDeckHero, TopDeckBoucherville, and TopDeckJoliette) offer a 20% discount at checkout. You can apply this discount to TopDeck prices using the `--topdeck-discount` flag:

```bash
# Apply the 20% discount to TopDeck prices
python -m mtg_deal_finder cards.txt --topdeck-discount
```

When this flag is enabled, all TopDeck store prices (stores with "topdeck" in their domain) will be reduced by 20% before comparison, giving you a more accurate view of the final price you'll pay.

**Example:**
- Without discount: TopDeck price is $10.00
- With discount: TopDeck price is $8.00 (20% off)

This makes it easier to compare TopDeck prices with other stores that don't offer a checkout discount.

### Store Filtering

You can limit your search to specific stores:

```bash
# Search only TopDeckBoucherville
python -m mtg_deal_finder cards.txt --store topdeckboucherville

# Search only FaceToFaceGames
python -m mtg_deal_finder cards.txt --store facetoface

# Search multiple specific stores
python -m mtg_deal_finder cards.txt --store facetoface,topdeckhero,mtgjeuxjubes

# Search all stores (default)
python -m mtg_deal_finder cards.txt
```

### Caching

Search results are automatically cached for 24 hours to improve performance on repeated searches. Cached results older than 24 hours are automatically deleted when a new search is performed, ensuring you always get fresh pricing data. To disable caching:

```bash
python -m mtg_deal_finder cards.txt --no-cache
```

### Input Format

The input file supports various formats:

- **Simple card name**: `Lightning Bolt`
- **Card with set**: `Counterspell (7ED)` or `Counterspell [Seventh Edition]`
- **Card with quantity**: `Brainstorm x4` or `4x Brainstorm`
- **Combined**: `Counterspell (7ED) x2`

### Output

The tool generates an Excel file with the following columns:

| Selected | Query | Card | Set | Condition | Foil | Price | Quantity | Store | URL |
|----------|-------|------|-----|-----------|------|-------|----------|-------|-----|
| ‚úì | Lightning Bolt | Lightning Bolt | Masters 25 | Played | False | $1.99 | 1 | FaceToFaceGames | https://... |
| | Lightning Bolt | Lightning Bolt | Premium Deck | Near Mint | False | $2.49 | 1 | FaceToFaceGames | https://... |
| | Lightning Bolt | Lightning Bolt | The List | Played | False | $1.99 | 0 | FaceToFaceGames | https://... |

**Key features:**
- **All offers are included** - The Excel file contains every available offer found across all stores, not just the selected ones
- **Selected offers are marked** - The "Selected" column shows a ‚úì for offers chosen by your selection strategy
- **Quantity indicates availability** - 1 means in stock, 0 means out of stock
- **Sorted for easy review** - Results are sorted by card name, selected offers first, then by price

This allows you to review all available options and understand why a particular offer was selected, making it easy to choose an alternative if needed.


## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Strategy

### 1. Input

The tool accepts a plain text file or multiline string where each line represents a card.

Example input:
```
Lightning Bolt
Sol Ring
Counterspell (7ED)
Brainstorm x4
```

Each line is parsed into a structured `Card` object with attributes: `name`, `set`, and `quantity`.

### 2. Core Architecture

Folder structure:

```
mtg_deal_finder/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py                  # CLI entrypoint and orchestration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cards.py                 # Card and Offer data models
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ strategies.py            # Selection strategies for choosing best offers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ stores/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ base.py             # Abstract StoreScraper interface
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ facetoface.py       # FaceToFace scraper (uses store API)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ topdeckhero.py      # TopDeckHero scraper (HTML scraping)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [future stores]     # Additional store implementations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ compare.py               # Price aggregation and comparison logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ output.py                # Excel export logic
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ caching.py          # Local caching layer (24-hour TTL)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ normalization.py    # Fuzzy matching and validation
```

### 3. Common Data Models

- **Card** ‚Äî represents a card with fields: `name`, `set` (optional), `qty` (default 1)
- **Offer** ‚Äî represents a store offer with: `store`, `card`, `set`, `condition`, `price`, `url`, `foil`, and `availability`

Each store implements the same interface with a `search(card)` method returning a list of offers.
This makes adding new stores straightforward.

### 4. Scraping Strategy

- **API-first approach**: Use store APIs when available (e.g., FaceToFaceGames search API)
- **Static HTML fallback**: Use requests + BeautifulSoup for stores without APIs (e.g., TopDeckHero)
- **Dynamic pages**: Use Playwright or Selenium in headless mode when necessary (reserved for future stores)
- **Caching**: Cache results locally (24-hour TTL) to avoid re-fetching identical pages
- **Pagination**: Scrape up to 2 pages per store for better coverage
- **Rate limiting**: Add delays between page requests to stay polite and avoid rate limits

### 5. Selection Strategies

The tool supports multiple strategies for selecting the best offer from available options:

- **CheapestStrategy**: Select the lowest price regardless of condition or foil status
- **CheapestFoilStrategy**: Select the cheapest foil version
- **CheapestNonFoilStrategy**: Select the cheapest non-foil version
- **FoilFirstCheapestStrategy**: Prefer foil cards - select the cheapest foil if available, otherwise the cheapest non-foil
- **BestConditionStrategy**: Select the cheapest Near Mint condition card
- **BlingiestStrategy**: Select the most expensive foil card

Each strategy implements a `select(offers)` method that returns the best offer according to its criteria. This design makes it easy to add new strategies in the future (e.g., "cheapest within a specific set", "best condition within budget", etc.).

### 6. Normalization

Ensure consistent formatting of card names, sets, and conditions:

- Strip extra spaces, normalize capitalization and punctuation
- Optionally validate via Scryfall API for canonical names and set codes
- Handle foil and non-foil variants consistently
- Filter out non-English cards

### 7. Price Comparison Logic

Aggregate all offers from multiple stores, then use the selected strategy to choose the best offer for each card. This yields a clean, minimal list of best options across all stores.

### 8. Output

Results are exported to Excel using pandas with columns:

| Card | Set | Condition | Foil | Price | Store | URL |
|------|-----|-----------|------|-------|-------|-----|
| Lightning Bolt | Masters 25 | Near Mint | False | $2.49 | FaceToFaceGames | https://... |

The file is automatically sorted by price (cheapest first) and includes clickable URLs to product pages.
